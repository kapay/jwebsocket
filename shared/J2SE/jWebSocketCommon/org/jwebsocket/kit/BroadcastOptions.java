/**
 * This class holds the various options to broadcast a data packet in the
 * WebSocket network. When broadcasting the sender can decide if the packet is
 * supposed to be sent only (one-way packet) or if the server is supposed to
 * sent an acknowledge. The sender also can decide if the sender himself should
 * be a broadcast target or not - which might be required for certain business
 * logic.
